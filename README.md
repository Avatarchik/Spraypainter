While I wait for an eventual Oculus Quest [Kingspray](http://infectiousape.com/) port, here's something I whipped up in a few hours to tide myself over.

### Control Scheme
- Trigger: Spray!
- Joystick : Select Color from Color Wheel
- X/A Button: Change Hue of Color Wheel
- B/Y Button: Turn Paint White
- Menu Button: Switch Between Door and Brickwall scenes / Reset Map
- Right Joystick (Press): Switch handedness

### Install Process
Just grab the APK from the releases and drag it into SideQuest, nothing else required!
